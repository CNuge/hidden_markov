Hidden Markov Model
-------------------

An implementation of Viterbi Algorithm, Forward algorithm and the Baum Welch Algorithm. The computations are done via matrices to imporve algorithm runtimes. The hmm class takes emission, start probabilities and transition probabilities as matrix inputs and appropriate outputs matrices are produced.

Usage ::

    >>> import hmm
    >>> To be completed
